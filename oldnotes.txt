What I'm interested in, building / funding

A better blockchain user experience through social/passkey wallet login, account abstraction, gas sponsorship, secure recovery, etc or simply meeting the user in the apps they're on

Bridging the gap between the real world and crypto

DeFi and permissionless financial innovation

Security, decentralization, and building applications that remove the middleman and give the users choice

New uses for micropayments and privacy

Some of the things I did in the past

Head / VP of Engineering at Chainlink Labs
Grew a talented engineering team of 250+ building reliable oracle data, scalable automation and cross chain infrastructure. Connected the real world with DeFi, RWAs, NFTs and many decentralized smart contracts. 

CTO at BitGo
Developed the world's first multisig wallets, wallet SDKs and custodian services powering 15% of global bitcoin tx volume. 

Founding member in WBTC
We bridged Bitcoin as an asset to Ethereum. Our vision was for it to be inexpensive, transparent with proof of reserves, widely adopted and decentralized. We succeeded in some of those goals. https://twitter.com/loi_luu/status/1823244566457471012
